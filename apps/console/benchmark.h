     -maxTime: the maximum amount of time a planner is allowed to run (seconds); 5.0 by default.

     -maxMem: the maximum amount of memory a planner is allowed to use (MB); 4096.0 by default.

     -runCount: the number of times to run each planner; 100 by default.

     -timeBetweenUpdates: When collecting time-varying data from a planner during its execution,
     the planner's progress will be queried every timeBetweenUpdates seconds; 0.001 by default.

     -displayProgress: flag indicating whether progress is to be displayed or not; true by default.

     -saveConsoleOutput: flag indicating whether console output is saved
     (in an automatically generated filename); true by default.

     -useThreads: flag indicating whether planner runs should be run in a separate thread.
     It is advisable to set this to true, so that a crashing planner doesn't result in a crash
     of the benchmark program.
