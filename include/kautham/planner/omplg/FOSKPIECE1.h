    @par Short description
    KPIECE is a tree-based planner that uses a discretization
    (multiple levels, in general) to guide the exploration of
    the continuous space. This implementation is a simplified
    one, using a single level of discretization: one grid. The
    grid is imposed on a projection of the state space. When
    exploring the space, preference is given to the boundary of
    this grid. The boundary is computed to be the set of grid
    cells that have less than 2n non-diagonal neighbors in an
    n-dimensional projection space.
    It is important to set the projection the algorithm uses
    (setProjectionEvaluator() function). If no projection is
    set, the planner will attempt to use the default projection
    associated to the state space. An exception is thrown if
    no default projection is available either.
