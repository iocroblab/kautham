/*The KauthamDEGoal is mainly used to set as a derived class from a GoalRegion the operation distance which the planner is going to check in order to decide wether the goal has been reached or not.
In order to check the position and orientation of the objects at the goal configuration we define a method called smp2KauthamOpenDEState .
This smp2KauthamOpenDEState method moves the robot to its goal configuration and from them extracts the position and orientation of each element in the scene and fills the KauthamOdeobject structure.
We've added the onlyend bool for further improvements as we have considered interesting to set the possibility that the goal position to be just the position of the ending point (the tcp) instead of the position of each element.
the distance is considered to be the addition of the differences between each considered element's position and its goal position
