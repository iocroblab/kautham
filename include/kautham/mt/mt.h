///
/// The \e mt library is a set of classes and functions that implement
/// concepts from the domains of geometry and rigid body mechanics.
/// Here are some examples of the functionalities provided by the library:
///
/// - Parameterized floating-point type specifically designed for handling
///   tolerance-based (absolute and relative) equality and inequality tests,
///   as well as robust implementations of common math functions such as
///   inverse trigonometric functions, sqrt, log, etc. (e.g., sqrt of a
///   negative value that is smaller than the specified tolerance will yield
///   zero, not an error).
///   Refer to the documentation of the scalar.h and basic_scalar.h for
///   further details.
///
/// - Classes that model closed intervals, 3D vectors, 3x3 matrices,
///   quaternions, and rigid transformations, along with a comprehensive set
///   of meaningful operations that can be applied
///   (e.g., usual operator overloads, matrix inverse computation,
///   transformation propagation and interpolation).
///   The special cases of 3D unit vectors and unit quaternions have also
///   been implemented.
///
/// - Classes that model 3D geometric elements such as points, lines, planes,
///   spheres, cylinders, circles, and ellipses.
///   There also exist relation classes for querying the geometric
///   relation that exists between two elements
///   (distance, angle, intersections, etc.)
///
/// If the Boost library is installed (http://www.boost.org)
/// a variant datatype is avaliable that can contain any of the geometric
/// elements (uses boost::variant).
/// Also, all the basic math classes as well as the geometric element classes
/// (the only exceptions are the relation classes) have serialization
/// functions implemented (uses boost::serialization), which can be useful for
/// marshalling and persistence purposes.
/// Define the project-wide macros MT_USE_BOOST and MT_USE_SERIALIZATION to
/// make these headers available when including this file.
/// If MT_USE_BOOST is defined, but MT_USE_SERIALIZATION is not, then the
/// variant datatype functionality is included, but the serialization header
/// is not.
